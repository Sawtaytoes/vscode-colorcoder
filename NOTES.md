- Track `document`s.
- Listen for changes to the document's language.
- Listen for when a document has closed (hopefully this is separate from the `editor`).
- Refactor `colorize`.
  - Run TextMate and Semantic Tokens in parallel.
  - Cache TextMate registries. Remove when those documents are gone.
